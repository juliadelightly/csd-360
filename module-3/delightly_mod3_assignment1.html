       <h1> We Are The Magic </h1>

	   <div class="card">
       <p> During my time working in attractions at Disneyland, I had several opportunities
		   to create magic for guests in my area of the park, <span id = "location"> ___________
		</span>. We were always encouraged to do small acts of kindness for our guests whenever we could or felt so inclined.
		</p>

       <p> One day, at Alice in Wonderland, a very kind family was making conversation with me while they stood in line, and 
		   their young daughter was so bubbly and talkative and kept freely giving me sweet compliments, which I 
		   joyfully returned back to her. What she didn't know was that I had been carrying a <span id = "pin">
			__________ </span> in my pocket 
		   for weeks to give to a guest, but I had not found the right person to give it to yet. Once they got too far ahead 
		   in line to talk anymore, I immediately remembered my little treasure. Once the family got off the ride, I met
		   them at the exit and told the daughter, "You have the true heart of a princess, and I would like you to have this" 
		   and I handed her the pin. It featured the character Marie from The Aristocats and the words "You are Purrfect"
		   underneath it. Her face immediately lit up and her parents thanked me for the gesture, but I hadn't done it for praise,
		   it was enough to simply see how I could bring joy and inspire confidence in a lovely young woman. </p>
	
			<p> On another day, I was helping to greet and load our guests with disabilities at Mr Toad's Wild Ride and a family 
				approached me with a return time. I told them we would get them on as soon as possible. Their daughter, who 
				I later found out was named Elizabeth, suffered from Parkinson's, partial blindness, and complications with her
				brain development. Her favorite ride in the park was Mr. Toad's Wild Ride because of the <span id = "wildRide"> 
				_______________________________ </span> that 
				made for a very thrilling experience. I noticed she would get very restless when they approached this attraction in anticipation. 
				Her parents very shyly asked if they might be able to go twice since she is 
				blind on one side and wanted to see both sides of the track. I enthusiastically assured them that it would not be a 
				problem and their gratitude warmed my heart. Weeks later, they returned to the same attraction when I was working and I 
				greeted them by name, which surprised them, and I asked if they would like to ride more than once so that they 
				would not have to ask again. They were delighted at the offer and any time they came back when I was working, I always made sure
				Elizabeth left with the biggest smile on her face.</p>

		   <p> My last story is from Casey Jr. Circus Train. It was late and the park was near closing and I was walking up and down the
			   station, warming my hands and making casual conversation with the few guests that wandered into our line. This attraction
			   in particular is very slow at the end of the night. One guest came up to me and asked if it was possible for them to wait 
			   until midnight to be on the last train, and I said of course! It was no trouble to me, and there were so few people left in our 
			   line that they were not holding anyone up by waiting. As it turned out, they ended up being the last and only person in line at midnight, which meant they got the whole train to themself. I waved from the station as I saw them pass by on the track, and when they got back they thanked me several times before leaving, and I insisted it was a pleasure to accommodate them. I truly thought nothing of it besides the joy of creating a memorable moment for a guest.
			   Then, a few weeks later, I was called down to my manager's office, where he surprised me by presenting me with <span id = "kindGesture"> 
				___________________________________ </span> from this guest I had helped at Casey Jr. I was truly shocked, because at the time the only way to leave compliments for
			   cast members was to physically go to City Hall and fill out a compliment form, and it always seemed like such a hassle. It made 
			   me realize how sometimes even when an act of kindness can seem so small in the moment, you never truly know how much it means to 
			   someone.</p>

		   <p>It is moments like these that I miss the most from my days in Disneyland attractions. We genuinely had the ability to create magical moments for people and it was the best feeling in the world.</p>
